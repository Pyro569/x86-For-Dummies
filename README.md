# x86-For-Dummies
A repository full of programs written in x86 assembly language that are completely commented in an effort to teach x86 to people that don't understand x86 and believe they never will.  
Each folder contains a .asm file that is fully commented that has explanations as to what is going on as well as shell scripts to compile them using NASM. Each folder also includes a compiled version of each program that can be ran on linux via using "./{file name}"  
Side Note: These are 64-bit NASM calls, I may or may not make a 32-bit version of this repo later on
